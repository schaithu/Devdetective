DevDetective & Real-Time Messaging
This is a single-page web application that combines two powerful functionalities: a GitHub user search tool ("DevDetective") and a real-time email contact form powered by EmailJS. It's built with modern web technologies, including Bootstrap 5 for a clean, responsive layout.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling: Bootstrap 5, Google Fonts (Space Mono)

APIs:

GitHub API: To fetch user profile data.

EmailJS: To send emails directly from the client-side.

üöÄ Setup and Usage
Because this is a client-side application, running it is very simple. However, to enable the email functionality, you'll need to configure your own free EmailJS account.

Step 1: Get the Code
Download or clone the project files. The entire application is contained within the single index.html file.

Step 2: Set Up EmailJS
Go to EmailJS.com and create a free account.

From your dashboard, add a new email service (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).

Create a new email template. Your template must include variables to accept the form data. Use the following variable names inside double curly braces: {{user_name}}, {{user_email}}, {{to_email}}, and {{message}}.

Find your Public Key, Service ID, and Template ID from your EmailJS account dashboard.

Step 3: Configure the Code
Open the index.html file in a text editor and scroll to the <script> section at the bottom. You must replace the placeholder keys with your own.

Initialize EmailJS with your Public Key:

JavaScript

// Replace with your own EmailJS public key
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"); 
Update the Form Submission with your Service & Template IDs:

JavaScript

// Inside the 'contact-form' event listener
// Replace with your own Service ID and Template ID
emailjs.sendForm("YOUR_SERVICE_ID", "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID", this)
    .then(() => {
        // Success logic...
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Error logic...
    });
Step 4: Run the Application
Simply open the modified index.html file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). The application is now live and fully functional!

üîß How It Works
GitHub Search
The search functionality uses the native JavaScript fetch API. When a user clicks the "Search" button, a GET request is sent to the GitHub API endpoint: https://api.github.com/users/{username}.

If the request is successful (HTTP status 200), the returned JSON data is used to populate the profile card elements in the DOM.

If the request fails (e.g., a 404 Not Found error), an error message is displayed to the user.

Email Form
The contact form's default submission behavior is prevented using event.preventDefault(). Instead, when the form is submitted, the emailjs.sendForm() method is called. This method securely sends the form data to the EmailJS servers, which then use your configured service and template to send the email on your behalf, all without exposing your credentials or requiring a server.
